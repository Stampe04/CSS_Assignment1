    "In the beggining, we had some issues with the API itself, since we found the API documentation very confusing to navigate. However, this slowly became less of an issue as we went along and got more familiar with the documentation and the code. Furthermore, We had some initial issues loading the csv file properly, but this was solved by doing some simple research on handling csv files in Python. In addition, we ran into trouble with our API keys multiple times, as we kept running into issues with having enough tokens per day. We solved this by testing our code on a limited amount of data to use our keys sparingly, and then do the full run once we knew the code worked. "

    "We used a limit of \"max_authors\" to make sure we had enough API requests, as we have had to deal with that problem a lot. The filter for citations makes sure that OpenAlex only takes \"more relevant\" articles, which speeds up the process significantly. The \"author_count\" filter makes sure we only focus on \"smaller collaborations\" and don't focus on very large ones. The filter regarding \"eligible authors\" also filters out a lot, as it focuses on authors that have contributed a significant amount, which helps to signify their significance."

    "Before applying any of the filters or specific settings, we ran a testing round on just one person, which alone gave us an enormous output, and it was very difficult to find specific information in it. This alone made us realize how necessary it would be to apply filters when searching for multiple people, but in practice, we also realised just how powerful of a tool it can be, especially when there is very specific information you are interested in or a specific criteria or threshold you want to limit yourself to. Overall, we think they are an excellent tool.  \n",

As an example, if you choose to filter based on a work or an author that have been cited at least x amount of times, you may underrepresent authors or works that are legitimately good but have just not been used much or discovered yet. Moreover, this can overrepresent works or authors that may not be good anymore or have become outdated, just because they have been cited a lot. "
